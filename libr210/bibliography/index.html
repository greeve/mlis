    <p>Geographic information systems (GIS) is a powerful, multi-disciplinary tool used by individuals, academics, and businesses across the globe in a wide range of fields and practices. This annotated bibliography is created for academic libraries with an interest in geography and GIS technology. The bibliography lists various materials related to GIS that academic reference librarians can use to better understand GIS and help answer patrons' GIS-related inquiries. All items included in this bibliography are published after 2009 to help reflect the current state of GIS technology. The bibliography is organized by item type: <a href="#books">Books</a>, <a href="#online">Online Resources</a>, and <a href="#databases">Scholarly Journals and Databases</a>. An overview and description of each work is provided to assist an academic library choosing to include GIS-related sources in their library collection. </p>
