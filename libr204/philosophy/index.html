        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The discipline of library and information science is a deep well of knowledge and study. When drawn upon, this well seemingly never runs dry in providing rich understanding and experience to help librarians and information scientists best serve their user communities. An essential part of this well is the theory and practice of management and leadership. Over the years numerous case studies and research papers examine, question, and study the topic of management and leadership. From the little one can study in the course of a university semester, leadership stands out as an essential element of the information professional. One cannot be a good leader without understanding the basic principles of leadership. This web site is designed to share some of the basic principles and tenets of leadership learned this school semester.</p>

        <h2>Defining Leadership</h2>
        <div class="quotes_container">
            <h3 class="quotes">"Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall."  </h3>
            <img src="images/covey.png" align="left"/> <h4 class="author_name_white">(Covey, 1989, p. 101)</h4>
        </div> <!-- quotes_container div -->    
        <p>The research on leadership is exhaustive. Although it has been examined, divided, sub-divided, and looked at from various perspectives and contexts, it is still elusive to define. </p>
        <p>The following are a collection of principles to help define leadership.</p>
    </div> <!-- content div -->
</div> <!-- definition content div -->
	
<div id="people">
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Leadership is a commitment to people.</h2>
        <p>Leadership is about the relationship between leader and follower, not the sum of an individual's traits, skills, and decisions (Fairholm & Fairholm, 2000, p. 108). Without followers you can't have a leader. It is fundamentally a social process. </p>
    </div> <!-- content div -->
</div> <!-- people content div -->

<div id="service">
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Leadership is about service.</h2>
        <p>A sister principle to commitment to people, leadership is about helping people, not focused on the leader themselves. A great leader is first a great servant (Greenleaf, 1991). </p>
        <p>The power to lead and make appropriate decisions derives from the trust between leader and follower. This trust comes from the leader serving the followers as well as serving side-by-side with them. For correct decisions to be made within an information organization there must be <em>legislative leadership</em> which "relies more upon persuasion, political currency, and shared interests" (Collins, 2005, p. 11).</p>

<div id="obedient">
    <div class="content">
        <h2>An obedient leader is a good leader.</h2>
        <div class="quotes_container">
            <h3 class="quotes">"Increasingly, a leader has to be an <em>example setter</em>. In attitude and performance, the leader sets the tone and pace for the group, particularly in the field of ethical behavior." </h3>
            <img src="images/evans_ward.png" align="left"/> <h4 class="author_name_white">(Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 339)</h4>
        </div> <!-- quotes_container div -->   
        <p>The servant-leader is diligent in performing their role to the best of their ability. They don't just talk about what or how something should be done but they have the determination to act according to what they know and say. </p> 
    </div> <!-- content div -->
</div> <!-- obedient content div -->

<div id="anywhere">
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Leadership can be found anywhere.</h2>
        <div class="quotes_container">
            <h3 class="quotes">"[L]eaders within an organization are not only found at the top level. Leaders emerge naturally at each level within an organizational structure."</h3>
            <img src="images/evans_ward.png" align="left"/> <h4 class="author_name_white">(Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 329)</h4>
        </div> <!-- quotes_container div -->
        <p>Leaders exemplify "practitioner leadership" when they work "across traditional organisational and hierarchical boundaries, to tussle with and arrive as 'best solutions'" to the challenges facing organizations (Penlington, & Homstrom, 2013, p. 40).</p>
	</div> <!-- content div -->
</div> <!-- anywhere content div -->

<div id="seeing">
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Leadership is about seeing.</h2>
        <p>Effective leaders are self-aware and have developed the skill to see things as they really are and as they really will be, not as they want them to be. </p>
        <p>Since "[w]e tend to see what we expect to see" (Voros, 2001, 551), one's own perceptual biases and preconceived notions can interfere with seeing an organization's social, political, economic, and technological settings for what they currently are and what they may become in the future. We see "through perceptual filters. It is all about filters, mindsets and world views" (Voros, 2001, 551). </p>

<div id="adaptation">
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Leadership is about adaptation.</h2>
        <div class="quotes_container">
            <h3 class="quotes">"Successful managers work in the present but must always consider what the future may hold, so that they can shape their planning, decision-making and resource needs accordingly"</h3>
            <img src="images/evans_ward.png" align="left"/> <h4 class="author_name_white">(Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 528)</h4>
        </div> <!-- quotes_container div -->
        <p>Leaders practice "<em>lateral thinking</em>" allowing them to make surprising connections and visualize new patterns to help motivate and inspire their followers in working towards a common purpose (Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 341).</p>
    </div> <!-- content div -->
</div> <!-- adaptation content div -->

<div id="communication">
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Leadership is about effective communication.</h2>
        <p>Leaders know that good communication starts with good listening.</p>
        <div class="quotes_container">
            <h3 class="quotes">"Deciding when to write or when to talk is a matter of <em>fine judgment</em> [emphasis added] and an understanding of accepted organizational practices—some very formal, others rather informal"</h3>
            <img src="images/evans_ward.png" align="left"/> <h4 class="author_name_white">(Evans and Ward, 2007, p. 270)</h4>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Studying the principles of management and leadership is both timely and timeless for aspiring librarians and information scientists. The core that drives librarians and information scientists is working with and helping people. The core of management and leadership is positively working with people to achieve a mutually shared goal. </p>
        <p>
        Despite all the information on leadership that can be learned in the course of a university semester, it would be foolishly shortsighted to think there is little more to learn or discover. There is much about leadership that is still unknown. Leadership is just as much an art as it is a science and is an ultimate lifetime pursuit to understand, apply, and master. </p>
